#### Task description

This is an example of how to use a linked list or a hash table for counting frequency / number of occurences of words in a text file (a clear text or source code can be used as an input).

Create a program, which will open a text file for measuring the frequency (number of occurences) of words in a text file.

The results will be printed as a "histogram".
